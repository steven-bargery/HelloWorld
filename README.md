# A little about myself
Hi, my name is Steven and I created this to learn all about github!

## My Career
I am a certified IT Technician with over 10 years experience and comprehensive knowledge of technical support, hardware deployment, network configurations and web development.

## My Hobbies
I enjoy keeping fit whether it be visiting the local kickboxing gym or hiking in one of America's National Parks.
